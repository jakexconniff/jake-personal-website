# jake-personal-website

This is my first project for A-100. It utilizes Bootstrap, as well as a few animation packages, such as wow.js and animate.css.

It is to be used as a landing page for me as a developer, to give a brief overview of my experience and give a place to see the important
links, primarily my GitHub page. This will be deployed to my personal domain.
